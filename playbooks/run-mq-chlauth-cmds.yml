# Playbook file: playbooks/run-yaml-mq-chlauth-cmds.yml

# This sample playbook demonstrates how to invoke the runMQCmds role to run MQ channel authentication commands.
# Argument overrides are defined in file overrides_for_chlauth_cmds.yml which is passed in via the '-e' option when running the playbook.
#
# For example, to run the playbook while in the /playbooks/ folder, issue:
#
#   ansible-playbook ./run-mq-chlauth-cmds.yml -e @./vars/override_vars_for_chlauth_cmds.yml
#
# where '-e' is the option for extra variables. It is important to prepend the YAML form variables file with the '@' symbol as shown in the above example.
