# Sample file containing YAML form MQ for z/OS CF structure commands to be run by the runMQCmds role.
#
# Commands and their attributes are specified as key/value pairs. The key/value pairs are 
# identical to those that can be specified when using the MQ administrative POST REST API 
# to issue JSON format MQSC commands. Any key/value pairs not specified will be set to
# default values as defined for the queue manager on which commands are run.
#
# In YAML, it is important to specify case sensitive string names in single quotes, but note 
# that on the z/OS platform, some values may be translated to uppercase.

# Array of MQ commands.
mq_commands:
#
# z/OS specific command to administer CF structures.
#
# Display details about a CF structure.
  - command: display
    name: APPLICATION1
    qualifier: cfstruct
    responseParameters: [all]
# Display the status of all CF structures defined.
  - command: display
    name: '*'
    qualifier: cfstatus
# Backup a recoverable CF structure.
  - command: backup
    name: APPLICATION1
    qualifier: cfstruct
# The RESET CFSTRUCT command has been used here for simulation purposes only. Users would normally
# backup a recoverable CF structure to the MQ recovery logs so that it can later be recovered, if 
# the CF structure fails for some reason and is put into a FAILED state.
#
# The RESET CFSTRUCT command can only be run against CF structures that are at CFLEVEL(5).
#
# Simulate a CF structure failure by resetting the structure with action FAIL.
  - command: reset
    name: APPLICATION1
    parameters:
      action: fail
    qualifier: cfstruct
# Display the status of a CF structure to show that it is in a FAILED state.
  - command: display
    name: APPLICATION1
    qualifier: cfstatus
# Recover a CF structure that was previously backed up, and which is currently in a FAILED state.
  - command: recover
    name: APPLICATION1
    qualifier: cfstruct
# Display the status of a CF structure to show that it has been recovered and put back into ACTIVE state.
  - command: display
    name: APPLICATION1
    qualifier: cfstatus
