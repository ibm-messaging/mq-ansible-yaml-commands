# Cmds file for users to add their own YAML form MQ commands (see supplied cmds files for working examples).
#
# Commands and their attributes are specified as key/value pairs. The key/value pairs are 
# identical to those that can be specified when using the MQ administrative POST REST API 
# to issue JSON format MQSC commands. Any key/value pairs not specified will be set to
# default values as defined for the queue manager on which commands are run.
#
# In YAML, it is important to specify case sensitive string names in single quotes, but note 
# that on the z/OS platform, some values may be translated to uppercase.

# Array of my MQ commands.
