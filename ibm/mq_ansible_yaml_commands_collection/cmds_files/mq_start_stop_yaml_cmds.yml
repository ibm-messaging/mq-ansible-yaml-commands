# Sample file containing YAML form MQ start and stop commands to be run by the runMQCmds role.

# Commands and their attributes are specified as key/value pairs. The key/value pairs are

# default values as defined for the queue manager on which commands are run.

# In YAML, it is important to specify case sensitive string names in single quotes, but note 
# that on the z/OS platform, some values may be translated to uppercase.
